### Summary:

These are the most important dynamic programming algorithms used in competitive programming and interview preparation. Understanding these problems and their variants will greatly improve your problem-solving skills and allow you to tackle complex challenges in a more efficient manner.

The core of DP is recognizing when a problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems, and using either **top-down** (memoization) or **bottom-up** (tabulation) approaches to solve them efficiently.
