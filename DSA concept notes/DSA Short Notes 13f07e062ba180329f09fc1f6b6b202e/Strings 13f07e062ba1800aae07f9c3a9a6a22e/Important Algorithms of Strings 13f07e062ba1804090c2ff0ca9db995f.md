# Important Algorithms of Strings

Here are the most important and commonly asked string algorithms in interviews, along with a brief description of each:

### **1. String Matching Algorithms**

- **Naive String Matching**: A simple brute force algorithm for searching a pattern in a string by checking every substring of the given string.
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: Efficient string matching algorithm that uses a preprocessing phase to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
- **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: A hashing-based approach to find the occurrence of a pattern in a string, using rolling hash.
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: A more efficient string matching algorithm that skips sections of the string based on mismatched characters.
- **Aho-Corasick Algorithm**: Used for multi-pattern matching; builds a trie and searches multiple patterns in a string simultaneously.
- **Z-Algorithm**: Computes the Z-array, which is useful for pattern matching, finding the longest substring, etc.

### **2. Palindrome Related Algorithms**

- **Check if a String is a Palindrome**: A simple check to determine if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Find the longest contiguous substring of a string that is a palindrome. This can be solved with dynamic programming or expanding around centers.
- **Palindrome Partitioning**: Divide the string into substrings such that every substring is a palindrome.
- **Palindrome Permutation**: Check if any permutation of the string can form a palindrome.
- **Shortest Palindrome**: Given a string, find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters in front.

### **3. Anagram Related Algorithms**

- **Check if Two Strings are Anagrams**: Determine if two strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies.
- **Group Anagrams**: Group a list of strings into anagrams.
- **Find All Anagrams in a String**: Given a string and a pattern, find all starting indices of pattern’s anagrams in the string.

### **4. String Transformation**

- **String to Integer (atoi)**: Convert a string to an integer while handling edge cases like leading spaces, signs, and invalid characters.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Find the longest subsequence common to two strings.
- **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)**: Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string to another (insert, delete, replace).
- **Longest Common Prefix (LCP)**: Find the longest prefix common to all strings in an array of strings.

### **5. Suffix Tree and Suffix Array**

- **Suffix Array**: A sorted array of all suffixes of a given string.
- **Suffix Tree**: A compressed trie that represents all suffixes of a string in a way that allows for efficient string matching and substring queries.
- **Longest Common Substring**: Use suffix arrays or suffix trees to find the longest common substring between two strings.

### **6. String Hashing**

- **Rolling Hash**: Efficient hashing technique for substring matching and pattern search, often used in the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
- **Polynomial Hashing**: A method of hashing strings to allow efficient comparisons of substrings.
- **String Comparison with Hashing**: Use hashing to compare substrings efficiently without directly comparing characters.

### **7. Regular Expressions and Wildcard Matching**

- **Wildcard Matching**: Match a string with a pattern that includes wildcards (``, `?`), similar to regular expression matching but simpler.
- **Regex Matching**: Match a string against a regular expression (can involve more complex patterns than simple wildcards).

### **8. String Compression**

- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: Compress a string by counting consecutive occurrences of characters (e.g., "aaaabbcc" -> "a4b2c2").
- **General String Compression**: Apply general compression algorithms (e.g., Huffman Coding) to strings for efficient storage.

### **9. Substring Search**

- **Find the Smallest Window in a String Containing All Characters of Another String**: Given two strings, find the smallest substring of one string that contains all characters of another string.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring that does not contain repeating characters.

### **10. Binary Search on Strings**

- **Binary Search for String Matching**: Use binary search on lexicographically sorted strings or substrings to find the target string or pattern.
- **Binary Search for Smallest or Largest Prefix/Suffix**: Use binary search to find the largest or smallest prefix or suffix in a string.

### **11. String Sliding Window**

- **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**: Find the longest substring that contains at most K distinct characters.
- **Sliding Window for Substrings**: Move a window across the string to check properties of substrings (e.g., find substrings that contain a certain number of distinct characters or specific patterns).

### **12. String Parsing and Tokenization**

- **String Tokenization**: Split a string into tokens (substrings) based on a delimiter or regular expression.
- **String Split**: Given a delimiter, split a string into an array of substrings.
- **String Join**: Concatenate an array of strings into a single string with a specified delimiter.

### **13. Z-Algorithm**

- **Z-Algorithm**: Computes the Z-array for a given string, which is useful for pattern matching, string comparison, and finding repeated substrings in linear time.

### **14. Manacher’s Algorithm**

- **Longest Palindromic Substring in Linear Time**: Manacher’s algorithm finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string in O(n) time.

### **15. Bit Manipulation with Strings**

- **Binary String Operations**: Performing bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR on strings of binary digits.
- **Finding Subsets of Binary Strings**: Using bit manipulation to generate all subsets of a string representing binary numbers.

### **Common Problems Based on String Algorithms**

- **Palindrome Problems**: Checking, expanding, or transforming palindromes.
- **Pattern Matching**: Searching for a pattern or multiple patterns in a string.
- **Anagram Problems**: Finding and grouping anagrams.
- **String Comparison**: Comparing strings or substrings using hashing or edit distance.
- **Substring Problems**: Finding the longest or smallest substring with specific properties.
- **String Transformations**: Converting strings from one form to another (e.g., case changes, removing characters).

By mastering these string algorithms and concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to handle most string-related interview questions.
