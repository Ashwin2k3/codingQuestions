# All Types Question in Array

Array-based questions are diverse and can test various concepts ranging from basic operations to advanced problem-solving. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of concepts around which array-related questions can be framed:

---

### **Basic Operations**

1. **Insertion and Deletion**
    - Insert an element at a specific index.
    - Delete an element from a specific index.
2. **Traversal**
    - Print all elements of an array.
3. **Search**
    - Find the index of a given element.
    - Binary search on a sorted array.
4. **Update**
    - Update the value at a specific index.

### **Frequency and Counting**

1. **Frequency Count**
    - Count the occurrences of each element.
    - Identify the most/least frequent element.
2. **Majority Element**
    - Find the element that appears more than `n/2` times.
    - Elements appearing more than `n/k` times.

---

### **Sorting and Rearrangement**

1. **Sorting**
    - Sort an array in ascending/descending order.
    - Sort based on custom criteria (e.g., even first, then odd).
2. **Rearrangement**
    - Segregate positives and negatives.
    - Move all zeros to the end.
    - Alternate positives and negatives.
3. **Wave-like Array**
    - Arrange elements in a wave pattern (`arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2]`).

### **Searching and Pair Problems**

1. **Two-pointer Techniques**
    - Find a pair with a given sum.
    - Find a triplet with a given sum.
    - Find all pairs with a difference `k`.
2. **Binary Search Variants**
    - Find the first/last occurrence of a number.
    - Count occurrences of a number.
    - Search in a rotated sorted array.
3. **Closest Pair**
    - Find a pair with the smallest difference.

### **Subarrays and Subsets**

1. **Subarray Problems**
    - Find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).
    - Longest subarray with a given sum.
    - Longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s.
2. **Subset Problems**
    - Generate all subsets.
    - Subset with a given sum.
3. **Sliding Window**
    - Maximum/minimum of all subarrays of size `k`.
    - Longest substring with at most `k` distinct elements.

---

### **Mathematical and Statistical Concepts**

1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**
    - Compute prefix sum/suffix sum.
    - Range sum queries using prefix arrays.
2. **Mathematical Properties**
    - Find the missing number in a series.
    - Check if an array can form an arithmetic progression.
    - Maximum product subarray.

---

### **Special Arrays**

1. **Rotations and Cyclic Operations**
    - Rotate an array `k` times.
    - Find the pivot in a rotated array.
    - Circular subarray problems.
2. **Sparse Arrays**
    - Count the number of non-zero elements.
    - Store and manipulate sparse arrays efficiently.

---

### **Optimization Problems**

1. **Greedy Approach**
    - Minimize the maximum difference between heights after modifying elements.
    - Partition an array into two subsets with minimum difference.
2. **Dynamic Programming**
    - Longest Increasing Subsequence.
    - Maximum sum increasing subsequence.
    - Partition array for maximum sum.

---

### **Miscellaneous Problems**

1. **Matrix-like Problems**
    - Convert a 1D array into a 2D matrix and vice versa.
    - Spiral order traversal.
2. **Hashing and Index Mapping**
    - Find duplicates in constant space.
    - Index of the first repeating/non-repeating element.
3. **Game Theory and Simulation**
    - Simulate operations on an array (e.g., Josephus problem).
4. **String Conversion**
    - Convert characters to/from ASCII values.
    - Sort an array of strings.
5. **Others**
    - Find the kth smallest/largest element.
    - Maximum XOR of two elements in an array.

---

### **Real-world Applications**

1. **Scheduling**
    - Merge overlapping intervals.
    - Find free time slots from busy schedules.
2. **Stock Market Problems**
    - Maximum profit from buying and selling stocks.
    - Maximum difference between two elements.
3. **Search and Rescue**
    - Find the shortest path in a grid (modified array traversal).

Questions on arrays can also be combined with other data structures (e.g., using stacks for monotonic array processing) to create hybrid concepts.
