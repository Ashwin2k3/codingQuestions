Certainly! The approach we're using here is known as **Binary Search on Partitions**. The problem is to find the median of two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, without merging them. By leveraging binary search, we can achieve this in \(O(\log(\min(n_1, n_2)))\) time complexity, where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the approach:

### Step 1: Ensure `nums1` is the Smaller Array
We start by ensuring that `nums1` is the smaller of the two arrays. This is because we’ll perform binary search on `nums1`, and having it be the smaller array helps us minimize the range of our search, which simplifies boundary conditions.

### Step 2: Define Partitions
To find the median, we want to split `nums1` and `nums2` such that:
- The left part contains half of the elements (or half + 1 if the total number of elements is odd).
- The right part contains the remaining elements.

If `nums1` has length `n1` and `nums2` has length `n2`, then the total number of elements is `n1 + n2`. Let’s denote the position at which we split `nums1` as `m1` and `nums2` as `m2`.

Since we want the left half to have `(n1 + n2 + 1) / 2` elements (to cover both odd and even cases), we get:
\[ m2 = \frac{(n1 + n2 + 1)}{2} - m1 \]

Here:
- `m1` is the midpoint in `nums1` we’re testing with binary search.
- `m2` is calculated from `m1` and positions the midpoint in `nums2`.

### Step 3: Binary Search Setup
We’ll initialize `l = 0` and `r = n1`, then use binary search to find the correct partition of `nums1`.

### Step 4: Check for a Valid Partition
For each partition (i.e., for each `m1` and corresponding `m2`), we need to ensure:
1. All elements on the left side of the partition are less than or equal to all elements on the right side of the partition.
   
   Specifically:
   - `l1 <= r2` (largest element on the left of `nums1` <= smallest element on the right of `nums2`)
   - `l2 <= r1` (largest element on the left of `nums2` <= smallest element on the right of `nums1`)

   Where:
   - `l1` is the element just before the partition in `nums1`, or `INT_MIN` if `m1 == 0`.
   - `r1` is the element at the partition in `nums1`, or `INT_MAX` if `m1 == n1`.
   - `l2` is the element just before the partition in `nums2`, or `INT_MIN` if `m2 == 0`.
   - `r2` is the element at the partition in `nums2`, or `INT_MAX` if `m2 == n2`.

### Step 5: Adjust Search Range
If the partition isn’t valid:
- If `l1 > r2`, then we need to move `m1` (and therefore `m2`) to the left, so we reduce `r = m1 - 1`.
- If `l2 > r1`, then we move `m1` to the right by setting `l = m1 + 1`.

### Step 6: Calculate the Median
Once we find a valid partition, we can calculate the median based on the total number of elements (`n1 + n2`):
- **If the total number of elements is odd**:
  - The median is the maximum element of the left parts (`max(l1, l2)`).
- **If the total number of elements is even**:
  - The median is the average of the maximum element of the left parts and the minimum element of the right parts:
    \[
    \text{median} = \frac{\max(l1, l2) + \min(r1, r2)}{2.0}
    \]

### Why This Works
This binary search approach works because:
- We’re effectively narrowing down the point where the left and right parts of the combined array are correctly balanced.
- By only using half of the array sizes in binary search, we reduce the time complexity to \(O(\log(\min(n1, n2)))\), which is highly efficient compared to simply merging and sorting the arrays.

### Complete Code

Here's the final code with comments for clarity:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        // Ensure nums1 is the smaller array to minimize binary search range
        if (nums1.size() > nums2.size()) 
            return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);

        int n1 = nums1.size();
        int n2 = nums2.size();
        int l = 0, r = n1;
        
        while (l <= r) {   
            int m1 = (l + r) / 2;
            int m2 = (n1 + n2 + 1) / 2 - m1;

            // Boundary elements or actual elements around partitions
            int l1 = (m1 == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums1[m1 - 1];
            int r1 = (m1 == n1) ? INT_MAX : nums1[m1];
            int l2 = (m2 == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums2[m2 - 1];
            int r2 = (m2 == n2) ? INT_MAX : nums2[m2];
            
            // Check if we found the correct partition
            if (l1 <= r2 && l2 <= r1) {
                // If total number of elements is even
                if ((n1 + n2) % 2 == 0) 
                    return (max(l1, l2) + min(r1, r2)) / 2.0;
                // If total number of elements is odd
                else 
                    return max(l1, l2);
            } 
            else if (l1 > r2) {
                // Move m1 left
                r = m1 - 1;
            } 
            else {
                // Move m1 right
                l = m1 + 1;
            }
        }
        return 0.0;  // In case of an unexpected input, though we should never reach here
    }
};
```

This approach ensures that we handle edge cases like empty arrays, arrays of different lengths, and even or odd combined lengths, making it both efficient and robust.
